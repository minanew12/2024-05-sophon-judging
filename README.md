## Summary
The quantity is calculated incorrectly when depositing ETH to weETH.

The code treats **the quantity of eETH shares** returned by Etherfi `LiquidityPool.deposit` as **the actual quantity of eETH**, but these two quantities are not equal.

The Etherfi `LiquidityPool.deposit` and `stETH.submit` functions have the same behavior, both returning shares instead of the actual token amount. The protocol handles stETH correctly, but it doesn't handle eETH correctly.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `depositEth`, if `_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH`, `_ethTOeEth` will be called to get the `finalAmount`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L503-L516
```solidity
    function depositEth(uint256 _boostAmount, PredefinedPool _predefinedPool) public payable {
        if (msg.value == 0) {
            revert NoEthSent();
        
        }

        _depositPredefinedAsset(_finalAmount, msg.value, _boostAmount, _predefinedPool);
    }
```

`_ethTOeEth` will call Etherfi `LiquidityPool.deposit`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L832-L835
```solidity
    function _ethTOeEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // deposit returns exact amount of eETH
        return IeETHLiquidityPool(eETHLiquidityPool).deposit{value: _amount}(address(this));
    }
```

The comment in `_ethTOeEth` states that the return value is the amount of eETH, but in reality Etherfi uses `mintShare` and returns the amount of shares.

https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/LiquidityPool.sol#L523-L533
```solidity
    function _deposit(address _recipient, uint256 _amountInLp, uint256 _amountOutOfLp) internal returns (uint256) {
        totalValueInLp += uint128(_amountInLp);
        totalValueOutOfLp += uint128(_amountOutOfLp);
        uint256 amount = _amountInLp + _amountOutOfLp;
        uint256 share = _sharesForDepositAmount(amount);
        if (amount > type(uint128).max || amount == 0 || share == 0) revert InvalidAmount();

        eETH.mintShares(_recipient, share);

        return share;
    }
```

`_depositPredefinedAsset` is called in `depositEth`, which in turn called `_eethTOweEth`, and the parameter is the share quantity of eETH returned by `_ethTOeEth`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L556-L557
```solidity
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _eethTOweEth(_amount);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L843-L846
```solidity
    function _eethTOweEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // wrap returns exact amount of weETH
        return IweETH(weETH).wrap(_amount);
    }
```

**However, in `weETH.wrap`, the parameter should be the actual amount of eETH rather than the amount of shares, as there is a conversion relationship between the actual amount and the amount of shares, they are not equal.**

https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/WeETH.sol#L49-L55
```solidity
    function wrap(uint256 _eETHAmount) public returns (uint256) {
        require(_eETHAmount > 0, "weETH: cant wrap zero eETH");
        uint256 weEthAmount = liquidityPool.sharesForAmount(_eETHAmount);
        _mint(msg.sender, weEthAmount);
        eETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _eETHAmount); //@audit amount, not share
        return weEthAmount;
    }
```

`eETH.transferFrom` is to convert amount to share and then `transferShare`.

https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/EETH.sol#L111-L119
https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/EETH.sol#L143-L147
```solidity
    function _transfer(address _sender, address _recipient, uint256 _amount) internal {
        uint256 _sharesToTransfer = liquidityPool.sharesForAmount(_amount); //@audit convert amount to share
        _transferShares(_sender, _recipient, _sharesToTransfer);
        emit Transfer(_sender, _recipient, _amount);
    }
```

As for why the current test cases pass, it is because `MockEETHLiquidityPool.deposit` uses `eEth.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);`, which directly increases the amount of eETH and returns that amount directly, rather than returning the number of shares as in Etherfi.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/mocks/MockeETHLiquidityPool.sol#L18-L26
```solidity
    function deposit(address _referral) external payable returns (uint256) {
        _referral;
        
        uint256 mintAmount = msg.value / 1001 * 1000;
        
        eEth.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);

        return mintAmount;
    }
```
## Impact
As there is a conversion rate between the amount of eETH and the number of shares, which are not equal, the following situations may occur:
- If 100 ETH is deposited, 100 eETH and 90 eETH shares are obtained, then `weETH.wrap(90)` is executed, 10 eETH cannot be deposited into the pool, and the user loses assets.
- If 100 ETH is deposited, 100 eETH and 110 eETH shares are obtained, then `weETH.wrap(110)` is executed. Since there are only 100 eETH, the transaction will revert and the user will not be able to deposit assets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Like `_ethTOstEth`, return the difference of eETH balance instead of directly returning the result of `LiquidityPool.deposit`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L808-L813
```solidity
    function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
        IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```

# Issue H-2: Many cases `stEth::transferFrom` will transfer 1-2 less way, which would result in revert in consequent functions, because of not enough balance

## Found by 
Bauchibred, EgisSecurity, zzykxx
## Summary
When user calls `depositStEth`, he passes `_amount` param, which is set to `IERC20(stETH).safeTransferFrom()` func and then the sam `_amount` is passed down the chain:
```solidity
        IERC20(stETH).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _amount
        );

        _depositPredefinedAsset(_amount, _amount, _boostAmount, PredefinedPool.wstETH);
 ```
## Vulnerability Detail
The probability of issue appearing is high and you can check in the following discussion. It has also been classified as a High severity on past contests:
https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/issues/442

`stETH` is using shares for tracking balances and it is a known issue that due to rounding error, transferred shares may be 1-2 wei less than `_amount` passed.
This would revert on the following line as we have transferred `_amount - 1` and farming contract do not hold `stEth` funds:
```solidity
    function _stEthTOwstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // wrap returns exact amount of wstETH
        return IwstETH(wstETH).wrap(_amount);
    }
```
The impact may be bigger if the staking contract is implemented by 3rd party protocol and expect this the function to be always fine.
## Impact
- Contract functionality DoS

## Recommendation
Use lido recommendation to utilize `transferShares` function, so the `_amount` is realistic, or implement FoT approach, which compares the balance before and after the transfer.

# Issue M-1: `accPointsPerShare` can reach a very large value leading to overflows 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon-judging/issues/36 

The protocol has acknowledged this issue.

## Found by

## Summary
Each pool tracks the amount of points that should be distributed for one share of its LP token in the `accPointsPerShare` variable. This variable can reach very large values causing integer overflows. This is dangerous as it puts the protocol's functionality at great risks.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is the code that calculates `accPointsPerShare`. `pointReward` is a variable with 36 decimals precision because `blockMultiplier` and `pointsPerBlock` have both 18 decimals. The result is then divided by `lpSupply`. 
```solidity
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;
```

The problem with this approach is that lpSupply can be a small value. It can happen either naturally (for example, tokens with low decimals, like USDC and USDT) or on purpose (by a malicious depositor).

The malicious depositor can deposit just 1 wei of the lp token and wait 1 block to update the `accPointsPerShare` variable. Since `lpSupply` will be equal to 1, `accPointsPerShare` will remain a value with 36 decimals.

Let's now have a look at [pendingPoints()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L357C1-L385C1)
```solidity
    function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];

        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;

        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());

            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;

            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }

        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }

```
`pool.accPointsPerShare` is multipled by 1e18 once again, resulting in 54 decimals. This is not the end, in the return statement this value will be multiplied once again by `user.amount.` Depending on the token's decimals, the value will be scaled again. For 18 decimals, the value will reach 72 decimals. This will result in unexpected overflows because `type(uint256).max < 1e78`  


```solidity
        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare 
```

## Proof of Concept
In this test a first depositor deposits 1 wei worth of our Mock token to inflate the `accPointsPerShare`. In the next block, a honest depositor deposits `10_000` tokens. When `pendingPoints` is called, the transaction reverts because of an overflow.
```solidity
    function testOverflow() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        MockERC20 usdc = new MockERC20("Mock USDC Token", "MockUSDC", 18);
        usdc.mint(address(deployer), 10000e18);
        dai.mint(address(deployer), 1000e18);

        uint256 usdcId = sophonFarming.add(60000, address(usdc), "", false);

        dai.approve(address(sophonFarming), 1000e18);
        usdc.approve(address(sophonFarming), 10000e18);

        sophonFarming.depositDai(1000e18, 0);
        sophonFarming.deposit(usdcId, 1, 0);

        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        sophonFarming.massUpdatePools();

        address[] memory users = new address[](1);
        users[0] = deployer;

        uint256[][] memory pendingPoints = sophonFarming.getPendingPoints(
            users
        );

        for (uint i = 0; i < pendingPoints.length; i++) {
            uint256 poolsLength = pendingPoints[i].length;

            for (uint j = 0; j < poolsLength; j++) {
                uint256 currentPoints = pendingPoints[i][j];
                console.log(currentPoints);
            }
        }

        sophonFarming.deposit(usdcId, 10000e18 - 1, 0);

        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        sophonFarming.massUpdatePools();

        pendingPoints = sophonFarming.getPendingPoints(users);

        for (uint i = 0; i < pendingPoints.length; i++) {
            uint256 poolsLength = pendingPoints[i].length;

            for (uint j = 0; j < poolsLength; j++) {
                uint256 currentPoints = pendingPoints[i][j];
                console.log(currentPoints);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The `accPointsPerShare` variable becomes too large and breaks contract functionality

Escalate
The value 1e72 will be multiplied by the user amount, thus causing the overflow as in the provided proof of concept.

**mystery0x**

The extreme edge case isn't going to happen. You see, the user amount is only 1 wei when multiplying with the inflated accPointsPerShare (due to division by 1 wei of `lpSupply`). 

So, when `user.amount` and `pool.amount` become sizable amounts (updated via the next [`_deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L616-L617), `lpSupply` will no longer be 1 wei but rather whatever that has been last updated on [`pool.amount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L363) in `_pendingPoints()`.

**WangSecurity**

Do I understand correctly that the user still can deposit into the protocol by dividing their deposit into several ones? So they can successfully deposit all 10_000 tokens as the POC and later users will not have problems? @ZdravkoHr is it correct or not?

And @mystery0x as I understand, user.amount and pool.amount will be updated after the point when the revert happens, no? Cause if what you're saying is correct, the POC wouldn't work, no? Or the POC is wrong?

**ZdravkoHr**

When lpSupply becomes an 1e18 value, the accPointsPerShare will already be a very large value because in the updatePool function the amount is being added, not overwritten.

@WangSecurity, the problem is not that the user can't deposit, but that getPendingPoints will revert when the whole process depends on it

**mystery0x**

> When lpSupply becomes an 1e18 value, the accPointsPerShare will already be a very large value because in the updatePool function the amount is being added, not overwritten.

Can you run the test and show us the result reverting? I don’t think it’s going to be a problem since division by lpSupply (1e18) at this point is going to make accPointsPerShare diminished prior to having it multiplied to user.amount.

**ZdravkoHr**

The division by `1e18` will reduce the decimals of the `pointReward`, however this result will be added to the already big enough `pool.accPointsPerShare` value because there is an addition operation.

Here is the result of the PoC: 
![image](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon-judging/assets/42611094/b239619a-02cb-41ad-8336-a2d967927598)


**mystery0x**

@ZdravkoHr Hmm... addition would cause overflow for the max value of uint256?

We agree that the first addend `user.amount * accPointsPerShare /1e36` is already curbed after the second call. How big can the second addend `user.rewardSettled` initially go? Can you plug in some practical numbers for these two addends and then the summation of both?

```
        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
```

**ZdravkoHr**

But how is the first calculation curbed if there is an addition in any subsequent call and not assignment? The value will babe large decimals initially and will continue growing, there seems to be no way to decrease it

**mystery0x**

> But how is the first calculation curbed if there is an addition in any subsequent call and not assignment? The value will babe large decimals initially and will continue growing, there seems to be no way to decrease it

`pointReward * 1e18 / lpSupply` is trivial as `lpSupply` is no longer 1 wei but 1e18:

```
            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
```
Just plug in some numbers, and I'm sure no issues are going to be found. You're not multiplying two big numbers (rather just adding) in the last arithmetic operation of function `_pendingPoints`: 

```
        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
```

**ZdravkoHr**

With the default values from the tests, pointsPerBlock = 25e18 and allocation of 50%.
accPointsPerShare = 12.5e36

Users deposit and this value becomes > 12.5e36

Then we go here
```
        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;
         ...
        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
```

**mystery0x**

Ah, ok. @RomanHiden you might want to look into this edge issue in `_pendingPoints()`. 

**WangSecurity**

Based on the above discussion, I agree with the escalation.

Planning to accept it and validate with medium severity. Are there any duplicates of it?

**ZdravkoHr**

@WangSecurity, just searched for `getPendingPoints` and couldn't find a duplicate (there were 16 results). Maybe if @mystery0x knows of some

**mystery0x**

Many other reports touched on the topic but none of them identified the 1 wei culprit from the first and only depositor in the initial block(s).

It's noteworthy that the suggested mitigation, "to set a floor that a user has to deposit" will also solve the issues associated with #85 and #177.

# Issue M-2: Protocol won't be eligible for referral rewards for depositing ETH 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon-judging/issues/92 

## Found by 
h2134
## Summary
Protocol won't be eligible for referral rewards for depositing ETH, as the referral account is not properly set.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user sends ETH to contract **SophonFarming**, or calls ETH deposit functions, protocol will first deposit ETH on external protocols (Lido or Ether.fi) for minting staking shares, then warp the shares to the predefined assets (wstETH or weETH), then user  starts to earn reward points.

The external protocols allows caller to pass referral argument when depositing ETH, and referral account can be eligible for referral rewards if it is valid. Let's take Ether.fi for example:
```solidity
    function _ethTOeEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // deposit returns exact amount of eETH
        return IeETHLiquidityPool(eETHLiquidityPool).deposit{value: _amount}(address(this));
    }
```

To convert ETH to eETH, the function `deposit` in [IeETHLiquidityPool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x605f17e88027e25e18c95be0d8011ac969426399#code) is called. In fact, **IeETHLiquidityPool** exposes 2 deposit functions for users to deposit ETH, which have different signatures:
```solidity
    // Used by eETH staking flow
    function deposit() external payable returns (uint256) {
        return deposit(address(0));
    }

    // Used by eETH staking flow
    function deposit(address _referral) public payable whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        require(_isWhitelisted(msg.sender), "Invalid User");

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value, SourceOfFunds.EETH, _referral);

        return _deposit(msg.sender, msg.value, 0);
    }
```
The `_referral` parameter in the second deposit function indicates the referral account which will be eligible for referral rewards, as stated by ether.fi [here](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/getting-started/loyalty-points/referrals):
> This referral program covers both ether.fi and ether.fan, each 0.1 ETH staked via ether.fi or ether.fan earns the person who stakes > and the the person who referred 100 loyalty points.
>
> Note: Referral points may take up to 2 hours to display in your Portfolio.

Apparently, by calling the second deposit function and passing **address(this)** as `_referral` argument, our protocol expects to receive the referral rewards, however, this makes the referral as the same account as the depositor itself (msg.sender), this is invalid to ether.fi and no rewards will be granted to the account which uses one's own referral code for depositing.

Similarly, protocol won't receive referral rewards from Lido as it set referral to itself when submit to deposit ETH:
```solidity
    function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
@=>     IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```

## Impact
Protocol won't be eligible for referral rewards as expected, this can be significant value leak to the protocol.

## Recommendation
User `owner` account as referral instead of the caller contract itself.
```diff
    function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
-       IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
+       IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(owner());
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```

```diff
    function _ethTOeEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // deposit returns exact amount of eETH
-       return IeETHLiquidityPool(eETHLiquidityPool).deposit{value: _amount}(address(this));
+       return IeETHLiquidityPool(eETHLiquidityPool).deposit{value: _amount}(owner());
    }
```

This issue looks like Oportunity Loss which is not accepted as H/M by Sherlock. For example, a contract not opting-in for gas yield on Blast would not be a valid H/M.

I think this will mean a lot more than just `Opportunity Loss` given that many transactions are going to route through these calls. 

**WangSecurity**

@mystery0x could you please iterate why you think it's not an Opportunity loss?

**0xh2134**

This issue is not opportunity loss because:
1. It's not caused by loss of functionality but the wrong argument in the code;
2. It's protocol design to receive referral rewards, this can be seen from the code implementation (and sponsor's confirmation of this issue)

This issue may fall into this category:
> Loss of airdrops or liquidity fees or any other rewards that are not part of the original protocol design is not considered a valid high/medium

However because referral rewards is the protocol design, so this issue is valid.

**mystery0x**

@WangSecurity 
@0xh2134 addresses a valid point because of the erring integration (In the [example](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-openq-judging/issues/323) provided by Sherlock Criteria for Issue Validity doc, users do not have an option to claim their airdrops whereas the referral bonus in this context is readily claimable albeit is denied due to wrong input of function argument.)

https://github.com/sophon-org/farming-contracts/commit/73adb6759b899e1a192fb5e28a5cd6202b5c3ff2


**WangSecurity**

I agree that it's not an opportunity loss and doesn't qualify for a loss of rewards, since the protocol's code wants to receive them, but it doesn't due to code issue. Hence, I believe it's part of the original protocol design.

Planning to reject the escalation and leave the issue as it is.

**ZdravkoHr**

Isn't the main reward from stETH coming from beacon chain staking rewards and thia refferal fee is just an additional bonus?

**WangSecurity**

As I understand yes, but as I see in the code, these rewards are part of the protocol's design and they want to accrue them, but it won't happen due to an issue in the code. Or am I missing something?

If not, decision remains the same, reject the escalation and leave the issue as it is.

**ZdravkoHr**

How do we understand that they want to accrue them? 

**WangSecurity**

By the fact that they submit an address to receive the rewards, instead of address(0) for example, it would be fair if they didn't care. But, actually, looking at this issue a couple of times more, I'm not sure about it. Is it possible to see the code implementation of that submit function? I think it might shed some light on the problem.

**ZdravkoHr**

I found this function from the [LIDO contract](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/5fcedc6e9a9f3ec154e69cff47c2b9e25503a78a/contracts/0.4.24/Lido.sol#L922C1-L947C6) it seems the `referral` is used only in event emission.

```solidity
    function _submit(address _referral) internal returns (uint256) {
        require(msg.value != 0, "ZERO_DEPOSIT");

        StakeLimitState.Data memory stakeLimitData = STAKING_STATE_POSITION.getStorageStakeLimitStruct();
        // There is an invariant that protocol pause also implies staking pause.
        // Thus, no need to check protocol pause explicitly.
        require(!stakeLimitData.isStakingPaused(), "STAKING_PAUSED");

        if (stakeLimitData.isStakingLimitSet()) {
            uint256 currentStakeLimit = stakeLimitData.calculateCurrentStakeLimit();

            require(msg.value <= currentStakeLimit, "STAKE_LIMIT");

            STAKING_STATE_POSITION.setStorageStakeLimitStruct(stakeLimitData.updatePrevStakeLimit(currentStakeLimit - msg.value));
        }

        uint256 sharesAmount = getSharesByPooledEth(msg.value);

        _mintShares(msg.sender, sharesAmount);

        _setBufferedEther(_getBufferedEther().add(msg.value));
        emit Submitted(msg.sender, msg.value, _referral);

        _emitTransferAfterMintingShares(msg.sender, sharesAmount);
        return sharesAmount;
    }
```
Also, in [this article](https://blog.ts.finance/referral-programs-in-defi-analyzing-effectiveness-and-strategies-for-success/) it's explained that the rewards go to the specified address and not to the calling one - I didn't know that :D 

> To participate, users simply need to generate a referral URL from their Ethereum addresses and share the link with others. The referrer is rewarded with payback in LDO, Lido's native token, based on the amount of ETH staked by users who join through the referral link.


**0xh2134**

The way I see it, it's obvious that they want to accrue referral rewards:
1. When deposit into Lido, call `submit(address _referral)` function with `_referral ` being `address(this)` instead of `address(0)`
2. When deposit into Ether.fi, call `deposit(address _referral)` function with `_referral ` being `address(this)`, instead of calling the default `deposit()` function

The deposit events are processed by Lido / Ether.fi offline, and referral rewards are distributed to `_referral`. However, in the context of deposit event, the `msg.sender` is **SophonFarming** contract and `_referral` is also **SophonFarming** contract, as I confirmed with Ether.fi, no referral rewards will be distributed if `_referral` is the same as the `msg.sender`.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nmsxsyf/2024-06-07-10-13-15.png" alt="2024-06-07-10-13-15" border="0">

So, because they want to accrue referral rewards, they need to set `_referral` to a different address other than `msg.sender`, for example, the owner, then the owner can send referral rewards back to **SophonFarming** contract.

BTW, I believe it's highly likely that the referral rewards would be used as rewards to point holders, that's why the want to accrue them.

**WangSecurity**

Thanks for both of your answers. I also confirmed with the sponsor that these referral rewards are indeed part of their original design and they intended to receive them. I know that some may say it was known only after the contest, but I believe in this situation it's quite unclear from the code if they intended to receive them and all the watsons could ask sponsors about it during the contest. With that said, since the team intends to receive these rewards, but made a code issue leading to losing these rewards, planning to reject the escalation and leave the issue as it is.

# Issue M-3: `setStartBlock()` doesn't change the block at which already existing pools will start accumulating points 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon-judging/issues/108 

The protocol has acknowledged this issue.

## Summary
The function [setStartBlock()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L272) can be called by the owner to change the block number at which points will start accumulating. When it's called, the block at which already existing pools will start accumulating points will not change. Already existing pools will:
1. Start accumulating points from the old `startBlock` if the new `startBlock` is set after the old one.
2. Not accumulate rewards until the old `startBlock` is reached if the new `startBlock` is set before the old one.

## Vulnerability Detail
This happens because [updatePool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L411) considers the pool `lastRewardBlock` as the block number from which points should start accumulating and [setStartBlock()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L272) never updates the `lastRewardBlock` of the already existing pools to the new `startBlock`.

### POC
Runnable POC that showcases point `1` explained above. Can be copy-pasted in `SophonFarming.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_SettingStartBlockDoesntUpdatePools() public {
    address alice = makeAddr("alice");
    uint256 amountToDeposit = sDAI.convertToAssets(1e18);

    vm.prank(alice);
    dai.approve(address(sophonFarming), type(uint256).max);
    deal(address(dai), alice, amountToDeposit);

    //-> Pools original `startBlock` is `1`
    //-> Admin changes `startBlock` to `100`
    vm.prank(deployer);
    sophonFarming.setStartBlock(100);

    //-> Alice deposits at block `90`, which is after the previous `startBlock` (1) but before the current `startBlock` (100)
    vm.roll(90);
    vm.prank(alice);
    sophonFarming.depositDai(amountToDeposit, 0);

    //-> After 9 blocks, at block `99`, Alice has accumulated rewards but she shouldn't have because the current `startBlock` (100) has not been reached yet
    vm.roll(99);
    vm.prank(alice);
    sophonFarming.withdraw(0, type(uint256).max);
    assertEq(sophonFarming.pendingPoints(0, alice), 74999999999999999999);
}
```

Can be run with:
```bash
forge test --match-test test_SettingStartBlockDoesntUpdatePools -vvvvv
```

## Impact
When [setStartBlock()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L272) is called the block at which already existing pools will start accumulating points will not change.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In [setStartBlock()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L272) loop over all of the existing pools and adjust each pool `lastRewardBlock` to the new `startBlock`. Furthermore  [setStartBlock()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L272) should revert if the new `startBlock` is lower than the current `block.number` as this would create problems in points distribution accounting if the above fix is implemented.
